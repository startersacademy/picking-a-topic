  Focus on a benefit
</h2>

Note:

Now that you have a topic at a particular granularity (or level),
you should turn your attention to what benefit you want the audience to get from your talk.

Most talks at sandiego.js are informative (though some can be persuasive).

Beyond information, what is the benefit to the audience?
