Note:

By using the process I've outlined, together with the worksheet, you'll be able to PICK a topic.

Remember:

Start at the top and PICK a situation or general topic.

Then narrow that to a more specific level. You can write that down under one of the column headers.

Then pinpoint which benefit you are tracking and write down an additional note to clarify the talk.

Each box in the grid represents a short talk you can give.
