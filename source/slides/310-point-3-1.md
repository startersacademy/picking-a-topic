Note:
In the programming and IT world, these benefits fall into broad categories. 

You can, and probably should, be more specific than this, but you can use these categories to simulate your thinking.

Ask yourself: What benefit will they get with the information I'm providing?

Focusing on one of these benefits will help focus your presentation.
